# Homework Submission Guidelines

For each homework submission, please adhere to the following guidelines:

## 1. GitHub Repository Structure

Your submission must be contained within one or more GitHub repositories. If your project has distinct frontend and backend components, it is recommended to separate them into individual repositories (e.g., `your-project-frontend` and `your-project-backend`). Ensure your repositories are publicly accessible or shared with the instructors.

## 2. Local Setup and Execution

Each repository must include clear and concise instructions on how to set up and run the application locally. This should typically be in the `README.md` file and cover:

*   **Prerequisites:** Any software or tools required (e.g., Node.js, Python, Docker, specific database).
*   **Installation Steps:** How to install dependencies (e.g., `npm install`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`).
*   **Configuration:** Any necessary environment variables or configuration files.
*   **Running the Application:** The commands to start the application (e.g., `npm start`, `python app.py`).

## 3. Cloud Hosting and Deployment

To facilitate cloud hosting and deployment, a `Dockerfile` is a mandatory requirement for each service or application within your project. Your `README.md` should also include instructions on how to build and run your application using Docker, and ideally, how to deploy it to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, Heroku). This section should cover:

*   **Dockerfile:** A well-structured `Dockerfile` that correctly packages your application and its dependencies.
*   **Docker Build Command:** Instructions on how to build the Docker image (e.g., `docker build -t your-app .`).
*   **Docker Run Command:** Instructions on how to run the Docker container locally (e.g., `docker run -p 8080:8080 your-app`).
*   **Cloud Deployment Notes (Optional but Recommended):** Brief notes or links to documentation on how to deploy your Dockerized application to a chosen cloud provider.

The choice of programming language is flexible, as the final deployment will be via containers.
